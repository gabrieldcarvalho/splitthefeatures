# SplitTheFeatures
A restaurant related social app with awesome features 
An experiment with Eureka client-side service discovery to build a scalable microservices architecture

# What is it for?
If you're an indecise person and still wants to have no trouble ordering a good meal, we choose the restaurant for you and even give you a discount coupon!
* The discount value will be based in how much filter you input, high risk, high reward!
* You can choose how long it will take to expire the coupon, but once the coupon is generated there is no rollback! Choose it wisely!

# Hou to execute it
* Run the service-registry first, and then the others!
* Forget about the api-gateway -> didn't have the time to finish

# Things to be done:
* Tests and tests
* Swagger

# Future developments
* Authentication / Customer registrations;
* Location filtering, with a radius input;
* Restaurants validating coupons in order to make then available again;
